    "# Markdown Cheatsheet for Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "*Last Updated: 2021-04-08*\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is a powerful tool for formatting documentation in Jupyter notebooks. Below is a cheatsheet to help you format Markdown cells effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Headings\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the number sign (#) followed by a space for different heading levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `#` for titles\n",
    "- `##` for major headings\n",
    "- `###` for subheadings\n",
    "- `####` for 4th level subheadings\n",
    "\n",
    "## Emphasis\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following code to emphasize text:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bold text: `__string__` or `**string**`\n",
    "- Italic text: `_string_` or `*string*`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Symbols\n",
    "\n",
    "Surround mathematical symbols with a dollar sign ($), for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `$ mathematical symbols $`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Monospace Font\n",
    "\n",
    "Surround text with a grave accent (\\`), also called a back single quotation mark, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\`string\\`\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the monospace font for file paths, file names, message text that users see, or text that users enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Line Breaks\n",
    "\n",
    "To force a line break, use the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `<br>`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Indenting\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the greater than sign (>) followed by a space, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `> Text that will be indented when the Markdown is rendered.`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bullets\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a circular bullet point, use one of the following methods. Each bullet point must be on its own line:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A hyphen (-) followed by one or two spaces, for example: `- Bulleted item`\n",
    "- A space, a hyphen (-), and a space, for example: `- Bulleted item`\n",
    "- An asterisk (*) followed by one or two spaces, for example: `* Bulleted item`\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a sub bullet, press Tab before entering the bullet point using one of the methods described above. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Main bullet point\n",
    "  - Sub bullet point\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numbered Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a numbered list, enter `1.` followed by a space, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Numbered item\n",
    "1. Numbered item\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a substep, press Tab before entering the numbered item, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Numbered item\n",
    "   1. Substep\n",
    "\n",
    "## Colored Note Boxes\n",
    "\n",
    "Use <div> tags to display text in a colored box. Be cautious, as not all Markdown code displays correctly within <div> tags:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Blue boxes (alert-info)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Tip:</b> Use blue boxes (alert-info) for tips and notes. \n",
    "If it’s a note, you don’t have to include the word “Note”.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Yellow boxes (alert-warning)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "<b>Example:</b> Use yellow boxes for examples that are not \n",
    "inside code cells, or use for mathematical formulas if needed.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Green boxes (alert-success)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n",
    "<b>Up to you:</b> Use green boxes sparingly, and only for some specific \n",
    "purpose that the other boxes can't cover. For example, if you have a lot \n",
    "of related content to link to, maybe you decide to use green boxes for \n",
    "related links from each section of a notebook.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Red boxes (alert-danger)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "<b>Just don't:</b> In general, avoid the red boxes. These should only be\n",
    "used for actions that might cause data loss or another major issue.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graphics\n",
    "\n",
    "You can attach image files directly to a notebook in Markdown cells by dragging and dropping it into the cell. To add images to other cell types, use graphics hosted on the web with this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"url/filename.gif\" alt=\"Alt text\" title=\"Title text\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Restriction: You cannot add captions to graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Geometric Shapes\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `&#` followed by the decimal or hex reference number for the shape, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "&#reference_number\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For a list of reference numbers, see UTF-8 Geometric shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Horizontal Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "On a new line, enter three asterisks:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Internal Links\n",
    "\n",
    "To link to a section within your notebook, use the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[Section title](#section-title)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the text inside the parentheses, replace any spaces and special characters with a hyphen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can add an ID above the section:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"section_ID\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To link to a section that has an ID, use the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[Section title](#section_ID)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Important: Test all internal links to ensure that they work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## External Links\n",
    "\n",
    "To link to an external site, use the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__[link text](http://url)__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Surround the link with two underscores (_) on each side. Important: Test all links to ensure that they work."
