    "# 3.1 Data Structures and Sequences\n",
    "Python’s data structures are simple but powerful. Mastering their use is a critical part of becoming a proficient Python programmer. We start with tuple, list, and dictionary, which are some of the most frequently used sequence types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tuple**\n",
    "A tuple is a fixed-length, immutable sequence of Python objects which, once assigned, cannot be changed. The easiest way to create one is with a comma-separated sequence of values wrapped in parentheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "tup = (4, 5, 6)\n",
    "tup\n",
    "\n",
    "In many contexts, the parentheses can be omitted, so here we could also have written:\n",
    "\n",
    "tup = 4, 5, 6\n",
    "tup\n",
    "\n",
    "You can convert any sequence or iterator to a tuple by invoking tuple:\n",
    "\n",
    "tuple([4, 0, 2])\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "tup = tuple('string')\n",
    "tup\n",
    "\n",
    "Elements can be accessed with square brackets [] as with most other sequence types. As in C, C++, Java, and many other languages, sequences are 0-indexed in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "tup[0]\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're defining tuples within more complicated expressions, it’s often necessary to enclose the values in parentheses, as in this example of creating a tuple of tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "nested_tup = (4, 5, 6), (7, 8)\n",
    "nested_tup\n",
    "\n",
    "nested_tup[0]\n",
    "\n",
    "nested_tup[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "While the objects stored in a tuple may be mutable themselves, once the tuple is created it’s not possible to modify which object is stored in each slot:\n",
    "\n",
    "tup = tuple(['foo', [1, 2], True])\n",
    "\n",
    "tup[2] = False\n",
    "\n",
    "If an object inside a tuple is mutable, such as a list, you can modify it in place:\n",
    "\n",
    "tup[1].append(3)\n",
    "tup\n",
    "\n",
    "You can concatenate tuples using the + operator to produce longer tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "(4, None, 'foo') + (6, 0) + ('bar',)\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplying a tuple by an integer, as with lists, has the effect of concatenating that many copies of the tuple:\n",
    "\n",
    "('foo', 'bar') * 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the objects themselves are not copied, only the references to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unpacking tuples**\n",
    "If you try to assign to a tuple-like expression of variables, Python will attempt to unpack the value on the righthand side of the equals sign:\n",
    "\n",
    "tup = (4, 5, 6)\n",
    "\n",
    "a, b, c = tup\n",
    "\n",
    "b\n",
    "\n",
    "Even sequences with nested tuples can be unpacked:\n",
    "\n",
    "tup = 4, 5, (6, 7)\n",
    "\n",
    "a, b, (c, d) = tup\n",
    "\n",
    "d\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this functionality you can easily swap variable names, a task that in many languages might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "tmp = a\n",
    "a = b\n",
    "b = tmp\n",
    "\n",
    "But, in Python, the swap can be done like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "a, b = 1, 2\n",
    "\n",
    "a\n",
    "\n",
    "b\n",
    "\n",
    "In [29]: b, a = a, b\n",
    "\n",
    "In [30]: a\n",
    "Out[30]: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "In [31]: b\n",
    "Out[31]: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "A common use of variable unpacking is iterating over sequences of tuples or lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [32]: seq = [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9)]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [33]: for a, b, c in seq:\n",
    "   ....:     print(f'a={a}, b={b}, c={c}')\n",
    "a=1, b=2, c=3\n",
    "a=4, b=5, c=6\n",
    "a=7, b=8, c=9\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common use is returning multiple values from a function. I'll cover this in more detail later.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some situations where you may want to \"pluck\" a few elements from the beginning of a tuple. There is a special syntax that can do this, *rest, which is also used in function signatures to capture an arbitrarily long list of positional arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [34]: values = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n",
    "\n",
    "In [35]: a, b, *rest = values\n",
    "\n",
    "In [36]: a\n",
    "Out[36]: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "In [37]: b\n",
    "Out[37]: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "In [38]: rest\n",
    "Out[38]: [3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "This rest bit is sometimes something you want to discard; there is nothing special about the rest name. As a matter of convention, many Python programmers will use the underscore (_) for unwanted variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [39]: a, b, *_ = values\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple methods\n",
    "Since the size and contents of a tuple cannot be modified, it is very light on instance methods. A particularly useful one (also available on lists) is count, which counts the number of occurrences of a value:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [40]: a = (1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "In [41]: a.count(2)\n",
    "Out[41]: 4\n",
    "\n",
    "List\n",
    "In contrast with tuples, lists are variable length and their contents can be modified in place. Lists are mutable. You can define them using square brackets [] or using the list type function:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [42]: a_list = [2, 3, 7, None]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [43]: tup = (\"foo\", \"bar\", \"baz\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In [44]: b_list = list(tup)\n",
    "\n",
    "In [45]: b_list\n",
    "Out[45]: ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']\n",
    "\n",
    "In [46]: b_list[1] = \"peekaboo\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In [47]: b_list\n",
    "Out[47]: ['foo', 'peekaboo', 'baz']\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists and tuples are semantically similar (though tuples cannot be modified) and can be used interchangeably in many functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The list built-in function is frequently used in data processing as a way to materialize an iterator or generator expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [48]: gen = range(10)\n",
    "\n",
    "In [49]: gen\n",
    "Out[49]: range(0, 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "In [50]: list(gen)\n",
    "Out[50]: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding and removing elements\n",
    "Elements can be appended to the end of the list with the append method:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [51]: b_list.append(\"dwarf\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In [52]: b_list\n",
    "Out[52]: ['foo', 'peekaboo', 'baz', 'dwarf']\n",
    "\n",
    "Using insert you can insert an element at a specific location in the list:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [53]: b_list.insert(1, \"red\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In [54]: b_list\n",
    "Out[54]: ['foo', 'red', 'peekaboo', 'baz', 'dwarf']\n",
    "\n",
    "The insertion index must be between 0 and the length of the list, inclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning\n",
    "insert is computationally expensive compared with append, because references to subsequent elements have to be shifted internally to make room for the new element. If you need to insert elements at both the beginning and end of a sequence, you may wish to explore collections.deque, a double-ended queue, which is optimized for this purpose and found in the Python Standard Library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse operation to insert is pop, which removes and returns an element at a particular index:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [55]: b_list.pop(2)\n",
    "Out[55]: 'peekaboo'\n",
    "\n",
    "In [56]: b_list\n",
    "Out[56]: ['foo', 'red', 'baz', 'dwarf']\n",
    "\n",
    "Elements can be removed by value with remove, which locates the first such value and removes it from the list:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [57]: b_list.append(\"foo\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In [58]: b_list\n",
    "Out[58]: ['foo', 'red', 'baz', 'dwarf', 'foo']\n",
    "\n",
    "In [59]: b_list.remove(\"foo\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In [60]: b_list\n",
    "Out[60]: ['red', 'baz', 'dwarf', 'foo']\n",
    "\n",
    "If performance is not a concern, by using append and remove, you can use a Python list as a set-like data structure (although Python has actual set objects, discussed later).\n",
    "\n",
    "Check if a list contains a value using the in keyword:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [61]: \"dwarf\" in b_list\n",
    "Out[61]: True\n",
    "\n",
    "The keyword not can be used to negate in:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [62]: \"dwarf\" not in b_list\n",
    "Out[62]: False\n",
    "\n",
    "Checking whether a list contains a value is a lot slower than doing so with dictionaries and sets (to be introduced shortly), as Python makes a linear scan across the values of the list, whereas it can check the others (based on hash tables) in constant time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concatenating and combining lists\n",
    "Similar to tuples, adding two lists together with + concatenates them:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [63]: [4, None, \"foo\"] + [7, 8, (2, 3)]\n",
    "Out[63]: [4, None, 'foo', 7, 8, (2, 3)]\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a list already defined, you can append multiple elements to it using the extend method:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [64]: x = [4, None, \"foo\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [65]: x.extend([7, 8, (2, 3)])\n",
    "\n",
    "In [66]: x\n",
    "Out[66]: [4, None, 'foo', 7, 8, (2, 3)]\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that list concatenation by addition is a comparatively expensive operation since a new list must be created and the objects copied over. Using extend to append elements to an existing list, especially if you are building up a large list, is usually preferable. Thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "everything = []\n",
    "for chunk in list_of_lists:\n",
    "    everything.extend(chunk)\n",
    "\n",
    "is faster than the concatenative alternative:\n",
    "\n",
    "everything = []\n",
    "for chunk in list_of_lists:\n",
    "    everything = everything + chunk\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorting\n",
    "You can sort a list in place (without creating a new object) by calling its sort function:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [67]: a = [7, 2, 5, 1, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [68]: a.sort()\n",
    "\n",
    "In [69]: a\n",
    "Out[69]: [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]\n",
    "\n",
    "sort has a few options that will occasionally come in handy. One is the ability to pass a secondary sort key—that is, a function that produces a value to use to sort the objects. For example, we could sort a collection of strings by their lengths:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [70]: b = [\"saw\", \"small\", \"He\", \"foxes\", \"six\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [71]: b.sort(key=len)\n",
    "\n",
    "In [72]: b\n",
    "Out[72]: ['He', 'saw', 'six', 'small', 'foxes']\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon, we'll look at the sorted function, which can produce a sorted copy of a general sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slicing\n",
    "You can select sections of most sequence types by using slice notation, which in its basic form consists of start:stop passed to the indexing operator []:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [73]: seq = [7, 2, 3, 7, 5, 6, 0, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [74]: seq[1:5]\n",
    "Out[74]: [2, 3, 7, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "Slices can also be assigned with a sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [75]: seq[3:5] = [6, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [76]: seq\n",
    "Out[76]: [7, 2, 3, 6, 3, 6, 0, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "While the element at the start index is included, the stop index is not included, so that the number of elements in the result is stop - start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Either the start or stop can be omitted, in which case they default to the start of the sequence and the end of the sequence, respectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [77]: seq[:5]\n",
    "Out[77]: [7, 2, 3, 6, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [78]: seq[3:]\n",
    "Out[78]: [6, 3, 6, 0, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative indices slice the sequence relative to the end:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [79]: seq[-4:]\n",
    "Out[79]: [3, 6, 0, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [80]: seq[-6:-2]\n",
    "Out[80]: [3, 6, 3, 6]\n",
    "\n",
    "Slicing semantics takes a bit of getting used to, especially if you’re coming from R or MATLAB. See Figure 3.1 for a helpful illustration of slicing with positive and negative integers. In the figure, the indices are shown at the \"bin edges\" to help show where the slice selections start and stop using positive or negative indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 3.1: Illustration of Python slicing conventions\n",
    "A step can also be used after a second colon to, say, take every other element:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [81]: seq[::2]\n",
    "Out[81]: [7, 3, 3, 0]\n",
    "\n",
    "A clever use of this is to pass -1, which has the useful effect of reversing a list or tuple:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [82]: seq[::-1]\n",
    "Out[82]: [1, 0, 6, 3, 6, 3, 2, 7]\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary\n",
    "The dictionary or dict may be the most important built-in Python data structure. In other programming languages, dictionaries are sometimes called hash maps or associative arrays. A dictionary stores a collection of key-value pairs, where key and value are Python objects. Each key is associated with a value so that a value can be conveniently retrieved, inserted, modified, or deleted given a particular key. One approach for creating a dictionary is to use curly braces {} and colons to separate keys and values:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [83]: empty_dict = {}\n",

    "Out[85]: {'a': 'some value', 'b': [1, 2, 3, 4]}\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In [87]: d1\n",
    "Out[87]: {'a': 'some value', 'b': [1, 2, 3, 4], 7: 'an integer'}\n",

    "In [88]: d1[\"b\"]\n",
    "Out[88]: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",

    "\n",
    "In [89]: \"b\" in d1\n",
    "Out[89]: True\n",
    "\n",
    "You can delete values using either the del keyword or the pop method (which simultaneously returns the value and deletes the key):\n",

    "In [90]: d1[5] = \"some value\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In [91]: d1\n",

    "\n",
    "The keys and values method gives you iterators of the dictionary's keys and values, respectively. The order of the keys depends on the order of their insertion, and these functions output the keys and values in the same respective order:\n",

    "\n",
    "The update method changes dictionaries in place, so any existing keys in the data passed to update will have their old values discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating dictionaries from sequences\n",
    "It’s common to occasionally end up with two sequences that you want to pair up element-wise in a dictionary. As a first cut, you might write code like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "mapping = {}\n",
    "for key, value in zip(key_list, value_list):\n",
    "    mapping[key] = value\n",

    "\n",
    "In [105]: tuples\n",

    "Out[107]: {0: 4, 1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 0}\n",
    "\n",
    "Later we’ll talk about dictionary comprehensions, which are another way to construct dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Default values\n",
    "It’s common to have logic like:\n",
    "\n",
    "if key in some_dict:\n",
    "    value = some_dict[key]\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    value = default_value\n",

    "\n",
    "value = some_dict.get(key, default_value)\n",
    "\n",
    "get by default will return None if the key is not present, while pop will raise an exception. With setting values, it may be that the values in a dictionary are another kind of collection, like a list. For example, you could imagine categorizing a list of words by their first letters as a dictionary of lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [108]: words = [\"apple\", \"bat\", \"bar\", \"atom\", \"book\"]\n",

    "Caution\n",

    "Returning Multiple Values\n",
    "When I first programmed in Python after having programmed in Java and C++, one of my favorite features was the ability to return multiple values from a function with simple syntax. Here’s an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "def f():\n",
    "    a = 5\n",
    "    b = 6\n",
    "    c = 7\n",
    "    return a, b, c\n",
    "\n",
    "a, b, c = f()\n",
    "\n",
    "In data analysis and other scientific applications, you may find yourself doing this often. What’s happening here is that the function is actually just returning one object, a tuple, which is then being unpacked into the result variables. In the preceding example, we could have done this instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "return_value = f()\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, return_value would be a 3-tuple with the three returned variables. A potentially attractive alternative to returning multiple values like before might be to return a dictionary instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "def f():\n",
    "    a = 5\n",
    "    b = 6\n",
    "    c = 7\n",
    "    return {\"a\" : a, \"b\" : b, \"c\" : c}\n",
    "\n",
    "This alternative technique can be useful depending on what you are trying to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions Are Objects\n",
    "Since Python functions are objects, many constructs can be easily expressed that are difficult to do in other languages. Suppose we were doing some data cleaning and needed to apply a bunch of transformations to the following list of strings:\n",

    "In [193]: states = [\"   Alabama \", \"Georgia!\", \"Georgia\", \"georgia\", \"FlOrIda\",\n",
    "   .....:           \"south   carolina##\", \"West virginia?\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyone who has ever worked with user-submitted survey data has seen messy results like these. Lots of things need to happen to make this list of strings uniform and ready for analysis: stripping whitespace, removing punctuation symbols, and standardizing proper capitalization. One way to do this is to use built-in string methods along with the re standard library module for regular expressions:\n",

    "        value = value.title()\n",
    "        result.append(value)\n",
    "    return result\n",

    "A more functional pattern like this enables you to easily modify how the strings are transformed at a very high level. The clean_strings function is also now more reusable and generic.\n",

    "Anonymous (Lambda) Functions\n",
    "Python has support for so-called anonymous or lambda functions, which are a way of writing functions consisting of a single statement, the result of which is the return value.

    "\n",
    "I usually refer to these as lambda functions in the rest of the book. They are especially convenient in data analysis because, as you’ll see, there are many cases where data transformation functions will take functions as arguments. It’s often less typing (and clearer) to pass a lambda function as opposed to writing a full-out function declaration or even assigning the lambda function to a local variable. Consider this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [201]: def apply_to_list(some_list, f):\n",
    "   .....:     return [f(x) for x in some_list]\n",

    "Out[203]: [8, 0, 2, 10, 12]\n",
    "\n",
    "You could also have written [x * 2 for x in ints], but here we were able to succinctly pass a custom operator to the apply_to_list function.\n",
    "\n",
    "As another example, suppose you wanted to sort a collection of strings by the number of distinct letters in each string:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [204]: strings = [\"foo\", \"card\", \"bar\", \"aaaa\", \"abab\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we could pass a lambda function to the list’s sort method:\n",

    "\n",
    "Generators\n",
    "Many objects in Python support iteration, such as over objects in a list or lines in a file. This is accomplished by means of the iterator protocol, a generic way to make objects iterable. For example, iterating over a dictionary yields the dictionary keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [207]: some_dict = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": 3}\n",

    "An iterator is any object that will yield objects to the Python interpreter when used in a context like a for loop.

    "A generator is a convenient way, similar to writing a normal function, to construct a new iterable object. Whereas normal functions execute and return a single result at a time, generators can return a sequence of multiple values by pausing and resuming execution each time the generator is used.

    "\n",
    "Generator expressions\n",
    "Another way to make a generator is by using a generator expression. This is a generator analogue to list, dictionary, and set comprehensions. To create one, enclose what would otherwise be a list comprehension within parentheses instead of brackets:\n",
