    "# Chapter 3. Built-In Data Structures, Functions, and Files\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter focuses on fundamental elements of the Python language that are essential throughout the book. It emphasizes the synergy between Python's built-in data manipulation tools and additional libraries like pandas and NumPy, designed for more complex computational tasks with large datasets. The chapter covers core data structures (tuples, lists, dictionaries, and sets), creating reusable functions in Python, and understanding the basics of working with file objects and local file systems.\n"
