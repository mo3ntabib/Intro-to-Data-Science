    "This chapter 3 focuses on fundamental elements of the Python language that are essential throughout the book. It emphasizes the synergy between Python's built-in data manipulation tools and additional libraries like pandas and NumPy, designed for more complex computational tasks with large datasets. The chapter covers core data structures (tuples, lists, dictionaries, and sets), creating reusable functions in Python, and understanding the basics of working with file objects and local file systems.\n",

    "| `read([size])` | Return data from the file as bytes or string depending on the file mode, with an optional size argument indicating the number of bytes or string characters to read. |\n",
    "| `readable()` | Return `True` if the file supports read operations. |\n",
    "| `readlines([size])` | Return a list of lines in the file, with an optional size argument. |\n",
    "| `write(string)` | Write the passed string to the file. |\n",
    "| `writable()` | Return `True` if the file supports write operations. |\n",
    "| `writelines(strings)` | Write the passed sequence of strings to the file. |\n",
    "| `close()` | Close the file object. |\n",
    "| `flush()` | Flush the internal I/O buffer to disk. |\n",
    "| `seek(pos)` | Move to the indicated file position (integer). |\n",
    "| `seekable()` | Return `True` if the file object supports seeking and thus random access (some file-like objects do not). |\n",
    "| `tell()` | Return the current file position as an integer. |\n",
