    "1. **Tuple Manipulation:**\n",
    "   - Given the tuple `tup = (4, 5, 6)`, create a new tuple `nested_tup` that contains two copies of `tup` as its elements.\n",
    "   - Explain the difference between mutable and immutable objects using the example of tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "To create a new tuple `nested_tup` that contains two copies of `tup` as its elements, we can use tuple concatenation:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   tup = (4, 5, 6)\n",
    "   nested_tup = (tup, tup)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   The `nested_tup` will contain two copies of `tup`, making it a tuple of tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Immutable Objects:** Tuples are immutable objects in Python, which means once they are created, their contents cannot be changed. Any attempt to modify a tuple will result in creating a new tuple with the modified elements. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   tup = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "   # Attempting to change an element will raise an error\n",
    "   tup[0] = 5  # This will raise TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Instead, to \"modify\" a tuple, you have to create a new tuple with the desired changes, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   tup = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "   # Create a new tuple with the modified element\n",
    "   new_tup = (5,) + tup[1:]  # This creates a new tuple (5, 2, 3)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Mutable Objects:** In contrast, mutable objects like lists can be changed after they are created. You can modify their elements directly without creating a new object. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "   my_list[0] = 5  # This modifies the first element of the list\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Unlike tuples, lists allow for in-place modifications. Mutable objects are useful when you need to modify the contents frequently, whereas immutable objects provide safety and predictability because their contents cannot change once they are created."

    "\n",
    "   - **`append` method:** This method is used to add a single element to the end of a list. It takes one argument, which is the element to be added. If the argument is a list itself, it will be added as a single element at the end of the list. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "   my_list.append(4)  # Adds the element 4 to the end of the list\n",
    "   my_list.append([5, 6])  # Adds the list [5, 6] as a single element to the end of the list\n",

    "   After these operations, `my_list` will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, [5, 6]]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **`extend` method:** This method is used to add elements from an iterable (such as a list or tuple) to the end of a list. It takes one argument, which is the iterable containing the elements to be added. It appends each element of the iterable to the list individually. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "   my_list.extend([4, 5])  # Adds the elements 4 and 5 to the end of the list\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   After this operation, `my_list` will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   In summary, `append` adds a single element to the end of a list, while `extend` adds all elements of an iterable to the end of a list, effectively combining the lists."

    "\n",
    "2. **Illustration of `pop` method:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `pop` method in Python is used to remove an item with the specified key from a dictionary and return its value. If the key is not found, it raises a KeyError (unless a default value is specified). For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   d1 = {'a': 'some value', 'b': [1, 2, 3, 4], 7: 'an integer'}\n",
    "   removed_value = d1.pop('dummy', 'Key not found')  # Attempting to remove key 'dummy', with a default return value if key not found\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   After this operation, if 'dummy' key exists in `d1`, its corresponding value will be removed and returned in `removed_value`. If 'dummy' key doesn't exist, it will return 'Key not found'. \n",
    "\n",
    "   The `pop` method also has an optional second argument that serves as a default return value if the key is not found in the dictionary. If this argument is not provided and the key is not found, a KeyError will be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "   It's worth noting that the `pop` method is useful when you need to retrieve the value of the removed item, and it provides a way to handle cases where the key might not exist in the dictionary."

    "   After these operations, `union_set` will be `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}` (all unique elements from both sets), and `intersection_set` will be `{3, 4, 5}` (elements common to both sets).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Concept of Subset and Superset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Subset:** A set A is considered a subset of another set B if every element of A is also an element of B. In other words, if all elements of set A are contained within set B, then A is a subset of B. \n",
    "\n",
    "   For example, let's consider `a_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`. Now, if we define another set `b_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`, then `a_set` is a subset of `b_set` because all elements of `a_set` are also present in `b_set`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   a_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "   b_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Checking if a_set is a subset of b_set\n",
    "   is_subset = a_set.issubset(b_set)  # Returns True\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Superset:** Conversely, a set A is considered a superset of another set B if it contains all elements of B. In other words, if all elements of set B are contained within set A, then A is a superset of B.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Using the same sets as above, `b_set` is a superset of `a_set` because all elements of `a_set` are present in `b_set`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Checking if b_set is a superset of a_set\n",
    "   is_superset = b_set.issuperset(a_set)  # Returns True\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   So, in summary, a subset relationship means that one set contains only a portion of another set's elements, while a superset relationship means that one set contains all the elements of another set."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, tuples support concatenation using the `+` operator and the `extend` method is not available for tuples since tuples are immutable and cannot be modified after creation. However, you can achieve concatenation by creating a new tuple that combines elements from both tuples. Let's demonstrate both approaches:\n",

    "2. **Using a secondary sort key:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate sorting based on a secondary key, let's sort the list based on the remainder when divided by 2. This will effectively sort even numbers before odd numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [7, 2, 5, 1, 3]\n",

    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[2, 7, 1, 3, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, the `key` parameter of the `sort` method is used to specify a function (in this case, a lambda function) that calculates the secondary sorting key. The lambda function `lambda x: x % 2` returns the remainder when each element `x` in the list is divided by 2. This effectively sorts even numbers (with a remainder of 0) before odd numbers (with a remainder of 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, after sorting, the list `[7, 2, 5, 1, 3]` becomes `[2, 7, 1, 3, 5]`, where even numbers (2) come before odd numbers (7, 1, 3, 5)."

    "- The `flatten_list` function takes a nested list as input and recursively flattens it. It iterates over each item in the list, and if the item is itself a list, it recursively flattens that sublist. If the item is not a list, it appends it to the `flattened` list.\n",
